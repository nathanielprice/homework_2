                <p>I am the Learning Management System Manager at the Association for Energy Affordability, Inc. Outside of the responsibilities of running our LMS, I also create curriculum, which includes diagrams and images that convey difficult concepts. I use Sketchup and Adobe Illustrator to create these images. As a result of years of working on images, I consider my self to be a Sketchup Ninja! I have produced over a 1000 images that we use in our PowerPoint presentations. I have also have images published in our Multifamily Resource Guide. </p>
                <p>As the Learning Management Systems Manager at AEA my eyes were opened to the world of coding. At one point in time in the not so distant past, we operated a open source LMS developed by the Department of Energy. This platform was written in the PHP coding language and I needed to become acquainted with the way that it worked. Once the funding was removed for this platform, the responsibility for its operation fell into my lap. It was a daunting task, but I was able to rebrand the LMS to replicate our website. This planted the coding seed deep into my brain and it is the reason I am here. I am excited to be expanding my horizons by participating in this Coding Boot-camp.</p>  <!-- This is my bio summary -->
